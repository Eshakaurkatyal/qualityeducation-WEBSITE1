    People are not well educated not in just INDIA but all over the world.
    The effects of illiteracy in India:The biggest effect of illiteracy in India is poverty,as per our study.<br> Poverty also happens to be the single biggest cause of illiteracy in India and a precursor to all other effects.
    Illiteracy affects all areas of life.<br> Those with low literacy skills are far more likely to live in poverty, face health problems because they can't read prescription labels or instructions, and grow isolated in a world increasingly dependent on computers.<br>
    The causes of illiteracy are many and varied.<br> The fact that it is frequently linked with poverty suggests that some of the causes could be the inadequate provision of schools, an inadequate number of properly trained teachers and the economic situation of families that make education for their children a low priority.<br>
    People don't know how to use resources wisely because they are not educated enough. Illitracy is becoming a big problem for nature as well. UN has included quality education as it's 4th GOAL.
