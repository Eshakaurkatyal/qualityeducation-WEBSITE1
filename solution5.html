            <h3><font color="mediumvioletred"> China’s focus on standardised testing has led to a teaching style that emphasises memorisation. For example, maths scores were rather high because children were pushed to memorise complicated formulas that they could use on problems given to them.

            Unfortunately, this system failed to equip children with the skills and thought processes to innovate. There was no focus on critical thinking.
            
            To change this, the Ministry of Education wants to shift the focus from memorisation to preparation for real-world situations. For a maths problem under the new system, for example, teachers would relate it to real-world use when they present it and, rather than just providing a formula to be applied, they would go over different methods of solving the problem and take a deeper look into why the problem can be solved that way.

        <h3><font color="mediumvioletred">
            The Japanese believe that hard work, diligence, and perseverance yield success in education as well as in other aspects of life. A certain amount of difficulty and hardship is believed to strengthen students' character and their resolve to do their best in learning and other important endeavors.

        <h3><font color="mediumvioletred">
            According to theOECD, France's education system is average, compared to other developed countries. ... Some 64% of all school pupils in France complete their secondary education, and take the high-school leaving certificate examinations, known as the baccalauréat or the baccalauréat professionnel.
            The French education system consists of three stages: primary education, secondary education, and higher education. ... Formal schooling in France starts as early as age three, when many children attend kindergarten (maternelle). Day care (pré-maternelle) is available from age two.
